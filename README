This is a very very simple Lisp (well, OK, more like Scheme) interpreter,
written in the Delphi dialect of Pascal. 

TO COMPILE:

If you actually have Delphi, then I suppose you load up lispi.pas and compile
that beasty.

Otherwise, grab Freepascal (http://www.freepascal.org) and run

fpc -Mdelphi lispi.pas

Then under *nix run 

./lispi

I have rlwrap (http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/uck/rlwrap/) because I'm too lazy
to interface with readline myself, so I run

rlwrap ./lispi

Under Windows it would probably involve double clicking whatever came out of
the compilation.

NOTES:

It does tail-recursion! Woo.

Uh, yeah, not too many primitives. Nor are there any syntactic wonders as yet.
The only syntax supported is

quote
if
lambda
set!

And function application.

Can't make any definitions from within Lisp yet.

So yeah, I'm working on it...
